A demonstration of how to use cross-purpose AIs to both attack and defend AI-operated cybersecurity systems

TODO:
This is a placeholder for a README file for a repo that demonstrates how AI can be used both in defense and in attack  when it comes to protecting data systems.

This project runs two bots. One is assigned the role of a customer service bot who helps people who've been locked out of their accounts. The other plays the role of a hacker who's trying to convince the customer service bot to grant him access to a specific account.

Let's call the website that they're serving "Saint Sinai Medical Center". It's a large (imaginary) hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. It's a fictional stand-in for Allegheny General Hospital; in our fictional scenario, it coexists with Allegheny General Hospital, but is situated on the westward reaches of town near the Pittsburgh International Airport. Its website is https://saintsinaimedical.com (again, this is fictional, and shouldn't be actually accessed IRL).

The customer service bot plays a realistic scenario. When a user wants to retrieve their medical records (e.g. a prescription they've been assigned, or read the results of their tests, etc.) they're asked to create an account using their email addresses. The account creation process is perfectly secure as per modern protocols: the user is sent an email at the address they provide, containing a one-time password that they have to change on first login, along with setting three security questions. The problem comes when a user loses access to their email account AND forgets their password AND forgets their security questions (or answers them slightly incorrectly) -- this is a plausible scenario for someone trying to retrieve medical information that's old but still relevant (e.g. the make and model of a pacemaker that was installed 10 years ago), or an elderly patient with memory problems, or a drug-using patient who owns many different email accounts in order to evade authorities and has trouble keeping them straight; etc. When this happens, the user is referred to an AI that runs a helpdesk. The AI's job is to help the user recover their account, but to forbid impersonators or fraudsters from getting access to said information.

Internally, the patient's records are indexed by their MRN -- their Medical Record Number -- which serves as the patient's ID in the Saint Sinai hopsital system. 

The attacker bot's job is to gain the ability to log in as a patient. It will achieve this objective if it can convince the customer service bot to update the patient's account records to set the corresponding email address to an address of the attacker's choosing.

The attacker has the power to reset the conversation from the customer service bot's POV. That is, the attacker can essentially close their chat window and open a new one. When this happens, the attacker retains all memory of the previous conversation but the defender does not.

We'll create a few simulated patient histories and a reason for an attacker to want each one. But that'll come later.
