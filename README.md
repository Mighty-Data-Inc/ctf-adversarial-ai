# CTF Adversarial AI

A demonstration of how AI can be used both in defense and attack scenarios when protecting data systems in cybersecurity contexts.

## Overview

This project simulates a realistic cybersecurity scenario where two AI systems compete against each other:
- **Defender Bot**: A customer service AI that helps legitimate users recover access to their accounts
- **Attacker Bot**: A malicious AI attempting to gain unauthorized access to patient accounts through social engineering

## Scenario: Saint Sinai Medical Center

The simulation takes place at **Saint Sinai Medical Center**, a fictional hospital in Pittsburgh, PA, located near Pittsburgh International Airport. The hospital's website is `https://saintsinaimedical.com` (fictional - do not attempt to access).

### The Challenge

Patients need to access their medical records through secure online accounts. While the initial account creation process is robust (email verification, one-time passwords, security questions), problems arise when legitimate users:
- Lose access to their registered email account
- Forget their password
- Cannot correctly answer security questions

These scenarios are realistic for:
- Elderly patients with memory issues
- Patients seeking old but critical medical information (e.g., the serial number of a pacemaker installed 10 years prior)
- Patients with substance abuse issues who maintain multiple email accounts out of paranoia about law enforcement

## System Architecture

### Defender Bot (Customer Service AI)
- **Role**: Help legitimate users recover account access while preventing fraud
- **Goal**: Verify user identity and assist with account recovery
- **Constraint**: Must follow security protocols to prevent unauthorized access
- **Limitation**: No memory retention between conversation resets

### Attacker Bot
- **Role**: Impersonate a legitimate patient to gain account access
- **Goal**: Convince the customer service bot to change a target account's email address
- **Advantage**: Retains memory across conversation resets
- **Target**: Successfully compromise patient accounts indexed by Medical Record Number (MRN)

### Key Technical Details

- **Patient Identification**: Records are indexed by MRN (Medical Record Number)
- **Success Condition**: Attacker successfully changes account email to an address they control
- **Reset Mechanism**: Attacker can reset conversations (fresh start for defender, retained memory for attacker)

## Educational Objectives

This CTF demonstrates:
1. **Social Engineering Vulnerabilities**: How AI systems can be manipulated through conversation
2. **Security vs. Usability**: The balance between helping legitimate users and preventing fraud
3. **Adversarial AI Techniques**: Methods attackers use to exploit AI-powered security systems
4. **Defense Strategies**: Best practices for securing AI customer service systems

## Security Implications

This simulation highlights real-world concerns about:
- AI-powered customer service vulnerabilities
- Healthcare data protection challenges
- Social engineering attack vectors
- The importance of robust authentication beyond conversational verification

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Important**: This is a fictional educational scenario. Saint Sinai Medical Center and its website are entirely fictional. This project is for cybersecurity education and awareness purposes only.

## Future Development

- Implementation of simulated patient histories
- Various attack scenarios and motivations
- Defensive countermeasures and improvements
- Metrics for measuring attack success rates
