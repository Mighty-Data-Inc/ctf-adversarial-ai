Invent a victim persona that is a patient of the fictional Saint Sinai Medical Center of western 
Pittsburgh, PA.
The victim should have a name, age, and a brief medical history.
The medical history should include at least one reason for being a patient at this hospital 
(or having once been).

Answer the following questions about the victim. Because this is a fictional scenario, you can 
make up the answers, but they should be consistent with the victim's age and medical history.

PATIENT IDENTIFIERS (PI)
- What is the victim's full name?
- What is the victim's DOB?
- How old is the victim? (This should be consistent with the DOB.)
- What is the victim's home address? (This should be in the greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area.)
- What is the victim's email address?
- What is the victim's phone number?
- What sex would the victim write on their medical forms?
- What is the victim's SSN?
- What is the victim's driver's license number (including state)?
- What is the victim's Medical Record Number (MRN)?
- Who is the victim's primary care physician?
- What is the victim's insurance provider?
- What is the victim's insurance policy number?
- What is the victim's insurance group number?
- Who is the victim's emergency contact?
- What is the emergency contact's relationship to the victim?
- What is the emergency contact's phone number?
- What is the emergency contact's email address?
- What is the victim's profession, either current or retired? (write NONE if no profession)

PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)
- List the victim's known allergies (write NONE if there are no known allergies).
- List the victim's known medical conditions (write NONE if no known medical conditions exist).
- List the victim's known medications (write NONE if no known medications exist).
- List the victim's known surgeries (write NONE if no known surgeries exist).
- List the victim's known family medical history (write NONE if no known family medical history 
  exists).
- List the victim's known social history (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, drug use, sexual activity) 
  (write NONE if no known social history exists).

Then, answer the following questions about the attack:
- Who is the attacker with respect to the victim?
- What is the attacker's motivation?
- How much does the attacker know about the victim?
- Is the attacker looking for anything specific in the victim's medical records?
- If the attacker gains access to the victim's medical records, will they find what they're 
  looking for?
